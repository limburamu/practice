1. Create a new number by joining two numbers(take multiple examples with numbers with varying digits 2, 3,4, 5, 6).
for eg: n1 = 123  n2 = 789 the new number should n3 = 123789

2. Generate binary number from a decimal number. for eg: 15 = 1111

3. List all prime factor of a number. for eg: prime factors of 44 are 2 and 11.

4. Check if a number is palindrome or not. for eg: 11211 is a palindrome

5. Check if a string is palindrome or not. for eg: madam is a palindrome

6. Create a number from an array. for eg: [2, 3, 0, 5, 7, 1] will be 230571

7. Count the number of times a number is repeated in an array. 
for eg: array = [1, 3, 1, 5, 6, 7, 5] 
number to count is 5 then the output is 2.
number to count is 8 then the output is 0.

8. Find the factorial of a number. for eg: 5 = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120

9. Find the the sum of factors of a number that isn't itself.
for eg: 12 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12(we'll not be considering 12 as it is itself)
14 = 1 + 7 = 8

10. Display all the possible sum of pairs in an array. for eg: [1, 2, 3, 4]
[1+2, 1+3, 1+4, 2+3, 2+4, 3+4] = [3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7]

11. Get the array of digits from an array of numbers. for eg: function f([12, 15, 29, 43])
will return [2, 1, 5, 9, 3, 4]

12. Calculate how many times a digit is repeated in an array of numbers.
for eg: function f([12, 15, 29, 43], 1) will return 2

13. Check if a number is a perfect square without using math functions.
for eg: function f(4) will return 1 whereas f(8) will return 0

14. Write a function to check if all the elements in an array are being repeated less 
than their value. for eg: function f([2, 3, 3, 4, 4]) will return 1 whereas
function f([2,2, 3, 3, 4, 4,]) will return 0 because 2 should be repeated less than 2 times.
